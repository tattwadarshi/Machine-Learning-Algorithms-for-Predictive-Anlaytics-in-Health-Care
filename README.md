# Predicting Heart Disease using Machine Learning

This project will introduce some foundation machine learning and data science concepts by exploring the problem of heart disease **classification**.

It is an end-to-end example of what a data science and machine learning **proof of concept** might look like.

## What is classification?

Classification involves deciding whether a sample is part of one class or another (**single-class classification**). If there are multiple class options, it's referred to as **multi-class classification**.


## What we'll end up with

Since we already have a dataset, we'll approach the problem with the following machine learning modelling framework.

| 6 Step Machine Learning Modelling Framework |

More specifically, we'll look at the following steps in the machine learning pipeline:

* **Exploratory data analysis (EDA)** - the process of going through a dataset and finding out more about it.
* **Model training** - create model(s) to learn to predict a target variable based on other variables.
* **Model evaluation** - evaluating a models predictions using problem-specific evaluation metrics. 
* **Model comparison** - comparing several different models to find the best one.
* **Model fine-tuning** - once we've found a good model, how can we improve it?
* **Feature importance** - since we're predicting the presence of heart disease, are there some things which are more important for prediction?
* **Cross-validation** - if we do build a good model, can we be sure it will work on unseen data?
* **Reporting what we've found** - if we had to present our work, what would we show someone?

To work through these steps, we'll use pandas, Matplotlib and NumPy for data anaylsis, as well as, Scikit-Learn for machine learning and modelling tasks.

We'll work through each step and by the end of the project, we'll have a handful of models, all which can predict whether or not a person has heart disease based on a number of different parameters at a considerable accuracy. 

we will also be able to describe which parameters are more indicative than others, for example, sex may be more important than age.
